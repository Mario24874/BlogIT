    <p>Web development trends for 2025 promise to radically transform the way we create and experience online content. From the evolution of popular frameworks to the adoption of new technologies, the web development landscape is constantly changing.</p>

    <h2 class="post-subtitle">Evolution of Popular Frameworks</h2>
    <h2 class="post-subtitle">React and its Ecosystem</h2>
    <img src="/src/data/posts/images/ReactTrend.jpg" alt="React" class="post-image w-82 h-auto object-contain" />
    <p>React continues to be a mainstay in frontend development, with significant improvements expected by 2025. React is expected to focus even more on performance and optimization, with new features that facilitate the creation of faster and more efficient applications</p>

    <h2 class="post-subtitle">Hybrid Frameworks</h2>
    <img src="/src/data/posts/images/Hibrid.gif" alt="Hybrid Frameworks" class="post-image w-82 h-auto object-contain" />
    <p>Frameworks such as Next.js, SvelteKit and Remix are gaining traction, offering hybrid capabilities that combine server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG) and client-side rendering (CSR)4. This flexibility allows developers to create more versatile, high-performance applications.</p>

    <h2 class="post-subtitle">Emerging Trends</h2>
    <h2 class="post-subtitle">Progressive Web Applications (PWA)</h2>
    <img src="/src/data/posts/images/AppsProgresivas.jpg" alt="Progressive Web Applications" class="post-image w-78 h-auto object-contain" />
    <p>PWAs will continue to gain popularity due to their ability to deliver native-like experiences without the need for installation13. These applications offer better performance, offline operation and the ability to be installed directly from the browser.</p>

    <h2 class="post-subtitle">Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h2>
    <img src="/src/data/posts/images/IA_MachineLearning.jpg" alt="Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning" class="post-image w-78 h-auto object-contain" />
    <p>The integration of AI and ML in web development will intensify, enabling more personalized user experiences, advanced chatbots and more accurate recommendation systems.</p>

    <h2 class="post-subtitle">WebAssembly (Wasm)</h2>
    <img src="/src/data/posts/images/WebAssembly.jpg" alt="Web Assembly (Wasm)" class="post-image w-78 h-auto object-contain" />
    <p>WebAssembly is moving from promise to reality, enabling high-performance code execution directly in the browser. This opens up new possibilities for complex web applications such as video games and graphical editors.</p>
    
    <h2 class="post-subtitle">Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)</h2>
    <img src="/src/data/posts/images/RealidadesVirtuales.jpg" alt="AR and VR" class="post-image w-78 h-auto object-contain" />
    <p>The integration of AR and VR in web development will create immersive experiences, especially in sectors such as e-commerce, education and entertainment.</p>

    <h2 class="post-subtitle">Other Important Trends</h2>
    <img src="/src/data/posts/images/NocodeLowcode.jpg" alt="No Code and Low Code" class="post-image w-68 h-auto object-contain" />
    <p><b>Low-Code/No-Code Development:</b> Will make it easier for non-technical users to create web applications.</p>
    <img src="/src/data/posts/images/Web3.0.jpg" alt="Web 3.0" class="post-image w-68 h-auto object-contain" />
    <p><b>Web 3.0 and Decentralization:</b> Blockchain technology will influence the development of decentralized web applications (dApps).</p>
    <img src="/src/data/posts/images/IoT.jpg" alt="IoT" class="post-image w-68 h-auto object-contain" />
    <p><b>Internet of Things (IoT):</b> The integration of IoT devices into web applications will become increasingly common.</p>
    <img src="/src/data/posts/images/DevOps.jpg" alt="DevOps" class="post-image w-68 h-auto object-contain" />
    <p><b>Automation and DevOps:</b> Increased adoption of automation tools for testing and continuous deployment is expected.</p>
    <p>The future of web development in 2025 is shaping up to be a diverse and dynamic ecosystem, where efficiency, personalization and user experience will be key priorities. Developers will need to stay current with these trends to create innovative and competitive web applications.</p>
